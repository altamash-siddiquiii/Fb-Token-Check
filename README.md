# Facebook Access Token Checker

This is a simple Node.js application designed to verify the validity of Facebook access tokens. The project features:

- **User Interface:** A basic form that allows users to input their Facebook access token.
- **Backend Verification:** Built using Express.js and axios, it checks the token by calling the Facebook Graph API "me" endpoint.
- **Result Display:** If the token is valid, the user's name and ID are shown; if the token is invalid or expired, an appropriate error message is displayed.
- **Learning Resource:** A great project for learning how to integrate with the Facebook Graph API and build a basic Node.js/Express.js application.
